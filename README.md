### Instructions

Prior to running the following files, please ensure that the CLI is located in the parent folder (e.g. "../data/").

1. To begin the analysis, please run the `download.py` script in CLI, ensuring that the file is run while
   in the parent folder e.g. ("../scripts"). This part will consume around 3-4 minutes as large datasets are being downloaded into the `data/landing` directory.
2. Next, run the `preprocessing.py` which will output the data into the `data/raw` and `data/curated` directories respectively. This part will also
   consume around 3-4 minutes as well.
3. For the exploratory data and preliminary analysis, please visit the `pre_analysis.ipynb` notebook and click `Run All`.
4. Lastly, `modelling.py` will store all processes needed for modelling. Please run `modelling.py` in CLI, ensuring that the file is run
   while in the parent folder e.g. ("../scripts").
